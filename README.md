doorprize

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/f3ndot/doorprize.png)](https://travis-ci.org/f3ndot/doorprize)

A Rails site where cyclists who were "doored" can report their incident for statistics in Canada

Currently using the [MIT license](LICENSE) for the project.

Why?
----

Because, back in 2012, the Toronto police redefined what a "collision" is, and apparently that's a good enough reason to discontinue tracking "dooring" incidents.[1]

Because the police won't track dooring until they're ordered to do so.[2]

Because despite the fact that the Police board wants Toronto cops to review the policy, It'll take the Toronto Police 3 months to respond.[3] I can build a reporting database application in just 1/6 of that time.

Because I feel it's important to track and record something that's an issue in this community. By not tracking these incidents, how can we even begin adequately address the issue?
